/*                   QUESTION 12 
Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11,
 but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
 The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be 
 personalized with the person’s name.
 */

let names: string[] = ["Ali", "Sara", "Waniya", "Saba"];

// Print a personalized message to each person

for (let i=0; i< names.length; i++ )

console.log(`Hello ${names[i]}, I hope you're having a great day!`);

// console.log(`Hello ${names[0]}, I hope you're having a great day!`);
// console.log(`Hello ${names[1]}, I hope you're having a great day!`);
// console.log(`Hello ${names[2]}, I hope you're having a great day!`);
// console.log(`Hello ${names[3]}, I hope you're having a great day!`);
